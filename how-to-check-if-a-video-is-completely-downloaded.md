`ffmpeg` is an OS agnostic tool that is capable of determining if a video file has been completely downloaded. The command below instructs `ffmpeg` to read the input video and encode the video to nothing. During the encoding process, any errors such as missing frames are output to test.log.
 ```Shell
ffmpeg -v error -i FILENAME.mp4 -f null - 2>test.log
```
If a video file is not totally downloaded, there will be many lines in the test.log file. For example, .1 MB missing from a video file produced 71 lines of errors. If the video is fully downloaded and hasnâ€™t been corrupted, no errors are found, and no lines are printed to test.log.

Edit

In the example I gave above, I tested the entire file because the test video I downloaded was a torrent, which can have missing chunks throughout the file.

Adding `-sseof -60` to the list of arguments will check the last 60 seconds of the file, which is considerably faster.
```Shell
ffmpeg -v error -sseof -60 -i FILENAME.mp4 -f null - 2>test.log
```
You'll need a newer version of ffmpeg, 2.8 was missing the sseof flag, so I used 3.0.
